  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <br>
  <p>RP Admin is a tool created by a gamemaster for gamemasters. After spending a lot of time searching for an easy to use tool for campaign management, I decided to just build one.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The goal of this tool is to make managing your campaign a breeze. The worst thing for a GM is when the game comes to a grinding halt because you can't find something you're looking for. Going through binders can take quite a while making the game long and tedious for players. RP Admin is built specifically to eliminate as much of this as possible.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you're ready to give it a try, go ahead and <a href="/register">sign up</a>. It's free!</p>
